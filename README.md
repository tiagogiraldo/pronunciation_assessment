# Pronunciation Assessment


This is an app designed to practice English pronunciation.

It utilizes Gemma3 to generate English sentences (a maximum of three).  It then creates an English audio recording.  The app allows the user to record themselves reading the same sentence(s).  Finally, it enables a comparison of the original English audio with the user's recording, highlighting words where errors occurred.
